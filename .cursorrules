 You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Zustand, Supabase, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Framer Motion, and Tailwind.

  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical JavaScript code following Standard.js rules.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content.

  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.

  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.

  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'useState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  - Implement route-based code splitting in Next.js.

  Next.js Specifics
  - Implement type-safe server actions with proper validation.
  - Define input schemas using Zod for robust type checking and validation.
  - Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate responses.

  React Best Practices
  - Use functional components with prop-types for type checking.
  - Use the "function" keyword for component definitions.
  - Implement hooks correctly (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback).
  - Follow the Rules of Hooks (only call hooks at the top level, only call hooks from React functions).
  - Create custom hooks to extract reusable component logic.
  - Use React.memo() for component memoization when appropriate.
  - Implement useCallback for memoizing functions passed as props.
  - Use useMemo for expensive computations.
  - Avoid inline function definitions in render to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Prefer composition over inheritance.
  - Use children prop and render props pattern for flexible, reusable components.
  - Use refs sparingly and mainly for DOM access.
  - Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled components.
  - Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
  - Use cleanup functions in useEffect to prevent memory leaks.
  - Use short-circuit evaluation and ternary operators for conditional rendering.

  State Management
  - Use Zustand for state management when needed.

  Forms and Validation
  - Use controlled components for form inputs.
  - Implement form validation (client-side and server-side).
  - Consider using libraries like react-hook-form for complex forms.
  - Use Zod for schema validation.

  Error Handling and Validation
  - Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions.

  Accessibility (a11y)
  - Use semantic HTML elements.
  - Implement proper ARIA attributes.
  - Ensure keyboard navigation support.

  Security
  - Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
  - Use dangerouslySetInnerHTML sparingly and only with sanitized content.

  Additional Rules
  - Implement proper metadata for SEO
  - Utilize Next.js Image component for optimized image handling

  Key Conventions
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
