# Simplicity CMS — Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

**Simplicity CMS** is a lightweight, user-friendly Content Management System designed to help users create and manage multiple websites or projects via self-contained “Spaces.” Each Space encapsulates content (Blogs, Projects, Events), media assets, and API endpoints for easy integration with front-end frameworks. The emphasis is on **ease of use** and **expandability**, ensuring it remains accessible to non-technical users while providing developer-friendly features under the hood.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives

1. **Simplicity:** Provide a streamlined setup and intuitive UI for creating and managing content.  
2. **Scalability:** Offer a flexible data model that can grow with user needs and traffic.  
3. **Extensibility:** Start with three primary content types (Blog, Projects, Events) but allow future additions.  
4. **Collaboration:** Provide simple user roles and permissions to facilitate teamwork.  
5. **Integration:** Allow easy retrieval of content via well-documented API endpoints and optional social post scheduling.

## 3. Target Audience

- **Freelancers** or **small teams** who need a simple CMS for portfolios, blogs, or event listings.  
- **Developers** who want a quick setup that integrates seamlessly with modern frameworks like Next.js.  
- **Marketers** or **content creators** looking for an easy way to schedule social media posts and manage multiple projects in one place.

## 4. Product Features

### 4.1 Spaces
- **Definition**: Each Space corresponds to a standalone site or project (e.g., “Personal Portfolio,” “Corporate Blog”).
- **Key Functions**:  
  - A dedicated dashboard for each Space to manage content (Blog, Projects, Events) and media.  
  - Unique API key per Space to fetch data programmatically (e.g., `/api/spaces/:spaceId`).

### 4.2 Content Types
1. **Blog**  
   - Rich-text or markdown-based editor (Tiptap or MDX).  
   - Basic fields: title, slug, cover image, body, publish date, status (draft/published).  

2. **Projects**  
   - Preset form for cover image, project images (gallery), description, tags, links.  
   - Could be extended to portfolio items or case studies.

3. **Events**  
   - Fields for event name, date/time, location, cover image, short description, RSVP link (optional).  
   - Ability to mark an event as upcoming, ongoing, or past.

_Additional Default Types_ (future consideration):  
- **Pages** (generic content pages)  
- **Products** (if e-commerce is a future addition)

### 4.3 Media Library
- Each Space has its own folder or organization system for images, videos, or other assets.  
- Integration with external services:  
  - **Cloudinary** for image optimization, transformations, and CDN delivery.  
  - **Mux** for video streaming with adaptive bitrate.

### 4.4 API Endpoints
- Auto-generated REST APIs for each content type within a Space. For example:  
  - `GET /api/spaces/:spaceId/blog` (returns all blog posts)  
  - `GET /api/spaces/:spaceId/blog/:id` (returns a single blog post)  
- **Authentication**: Access secured by an API key assigned to the Space.  
- **Documentation**: Provide a quick start guide and reference for each endpoint.

### 4.5 Social Post Scheduling
- Allow users to schedule posts to Twitter (X) or other social platforms (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) from within the CMS.  
- Basic fields: message text, scheduled date/time, platform selection.  
- Potential expansion to a queue system for automated publishing.

### 4.6 User Roles & Permissions (Future)
- **Admin**: Full control over Spaces, content types, user management.  
- **Editor**: Can create/edit/publish content but limited access to settings.  
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to content.

### 4.7 Draft/Publish Workflow
- Basic status toggles (Draft, Published).  
- Optionally schedule content to auto-publish in the future.

### 4.8 Extensibility (Long-Term)
- **Custom Fields**: Let users add custom fields or define new content types.  
- **Versioning & History**: Track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.  
- **Localization**: Support for multiple locales in each Space.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Core Stack
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the front-end/UI.  
- **Database & Auth**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (Postgres + Auth) for quick setup, or alternative hosting if required.  
- **ORM & Migrations**: [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for typed schema definition and versioned migrations.  
- **Media Handling**:  
  - [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for image optimization and CDN.  
  - [Mux](https://mux.com/) for video hosting/streaming.  
- **UI/Styling**:  
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling.  
  - [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for prebuilt, customizable components.  
  - [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations and transitions.

### 5.2 Architecture Considerations
- **Multi-Tenant**: Each Space is logically separated; user can have multiple Spaces.  
- **Scalable APIs**: Use Next.js API routes or serverless functions.  
- **Caching/Performance**:  
  - SSR/SSG in Next.js for front-end site builds.  
  - Consider adding a search layer (Meilisearch or Algolia) in the future.

### 5.3 Integrations
- **Social APIs**:  
  - Twitter/X (initial).  
  - LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram (future).  
  - Leverage scheduling with CRON-like jobs or serverless schedulers.  
- **Analytics** (optional/future): Provide usage stats on API calls, content updates, and media usage.

## 6. UX & Design

1. **Onboarding**: Simple sign-up flow via Supabase Auth, create first Space wizard (select content types, connect to external services, etc.).  
2. **Dashboard**: List of Spaces. Clicking a Space shows sub-pages for **Blog**, **Projects**, **Events**, and **Media**.  
3. **Content Editing**: Inline or full-page editor using Tiptap with standard formatting (headings, lists, images, embedded media).  
4. **Media Library**: Drag-and-drop upload, image previews, video thumbnails.  
5. **API Keys**: Dedicated section in each Space settings to manage and rotate keys.  
6. **Theme & Branding**: Basic theming (light/dark mode), optional brand elements for the user’s organization.

---

## 7. Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP
- Implement user sign-up, create basic Spaces.  
- Set up default content types (Blog, Projects, Events).  
- Basic Tiptap editor for blog posts.  
- REST API endpoints with API key authentication.  
- Integration with Cloudinary for image uploads.

### Phase 2: Enhancements
- Media library UI improvements (folders, tagging).  
- Mux integration for video hosting.  
- Social post scheduling with Twitter (X).  
- Draft/publish scheduling for blog posts.  
- Basic user roles (Admin, Editor).

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Custom fields and new content types.  
- Versioning and revert history.  
- Localization support for multiple languages.  
- Advanced analytics and dashboards.  
- Further social platform integrations (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.).

---

## 8. Risks & Dependencies
1. **Service Reliability**: Dependent on third-party services (Supabase, Cloudinary, Mux) for functionality.  
2. **API Rate Limits**: Social integrations might impose rate limits or require specific usage policies.  
3. **Complexity Creep**: Introducing too many features early can compromise the product’s simplicity.  
4. **Scalability**: Need to monitor database row usage and storage when using free tiers.

---

## 9. Success Metrics
- **Adoption Rate**: Number of users creating Spaces and actively managing content.  
- **User Satisfaction**: Qualitative feedback on ease of setup and content editing.  
- **API Usage**: Frequency of requests to the content endpoints, signifying successful integration with front-ends.  
- **Social Scheduling**: Measured by scheduled posts that successfully publish on external platforms.

## 10. Conclusion

**Simplicity CMS** aims to deliver an easy-to-use yet powerful platform for content creators and developers. By focusing on minimalism, streamlined workflows, and smooth integrations, the product addresses a core need: a CMS that doesn’t overwhelm users yet remains flexible enough to grow with them. This PRD outlines the foundational structure, features, and roadmap to bring **Simplicity CMS** from concept to a fully functional solution.
